#  Bot Framework Tutorial for the YouTube Video Series

This repo is for my [YouTube video series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLz6hh7iUxR21Mv4A_TGqrPjZDB9GCFq6H) on building bots with the Microsoft Bot Framework.

With the preview release of the Bot Framework SDK v4, the days of this tutorial (both the videos and the code) are numbered. For code, I encourage you to take a look at the [conference bot](https://github.com/szul/conf-edui2018-bot) example that I am working on for the SDK v4. There will be a video tutorial series published soon that follows that code.

This tutorial was a handful of videos short of completion. I wanted to show how you could use built-in entities to handle "to" and "from" directions, as well as rich cards for when multiple results are returned for the trains; however, with SDK v4's release on the very near horizon, it made more sense to deprecate this repository, and the tutorial series, in order to concentrate on SDK v4.
