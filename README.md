#  Bot Framework SDK v3 Tutorial Code for the YouTube Video Series

This repository is for my [YouTube video series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLz6hh7iUxR21Mv4A_TGqrPjZDB9GCFq6H) on building bots with the Microsoft Bot Framework.

> This code is inefficient in many areas, and incomplete in others, and each file, and several methods, are created on a step-by-step basis in the videos, and archived in this code for reference. Please do not mistake this for a fully-functional, fully-optimized, and complete application.

With the preview release of the Bot Framework SDK v4, the days of this tutorial (both the videos and the code) are numbered. For code, I encourage you to take a look at the [conference bot](https://github.com/szul/conf-edui2018-bot) example that I am working on for the SDK v4. There will be a video tutorial series published soon that follows that code, and the code is much more optimized. I've decided against repeating the multi-file, step-by-step approach of this tutorial.

This tutorial was a handful of videos short of completion. I wanted to show how you could use built-in entities to handle "to" and "from" directions, as well as rich cards for when multiple results are returned for the trains; however, with SDK v4's release on the very near horizon, it made more sense to deprecate this repository, and the tutorial series, in order to concentrate on SDK v4. As a result, I've concluded the tutorial series by bringing the example to the fruition of a rich card result, and the videos talk about some of the finer points of changes for efficiency.
